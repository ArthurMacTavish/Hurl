## Why and What?

The Default Browser War in Windows is one of the reasons for creation of Hurl and Sometimes you might want to open a link in a browser of your choice, instead of the default one. Hurl is used to let you choose the browser everytime you click a link (links outside of browser). So naturally, It acts as default browser to do that. And hurl can be powered up with a _browser extension_ to let you open a browser tab in another browser.

- Fast startup and lightweight
- Supports adding your own browsers with Launch Args
- Web Extension to open browser tabs in Hurl

## Installation

Get the Installer from [Releases](https://github.com/U-C-S/Hurl/releases/latest). Your PC's Anti-Virus might warn that it's not secure to download or install it, You can ignore it as the executables are Raw files and are Un-signed. After installing, You need to set Hurl as the default `http/https` protocol handler in the Windows Settings. Use `Hurl Settings` App (from Start Menu App list) to customize the Browsers.
